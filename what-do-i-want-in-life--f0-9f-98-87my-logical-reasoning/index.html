            <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>Only for the strong-hearted. Also, if you are allergic to rubbish, you better keep anti-histamines by your side while reading this. These are some of my thoughts on one of human life’s important question. </em>😏</p><p>There is always a question burning 🔥 inside me since the day I started to know the world. But, unfortunately, I still can’t find the answer.<br>I tried many things. Sometimes, I used to sit alone for hours just thinking? What could be the answer? But still no. Sometimes I used to put a tantrum with myself to find the answer. But still no.</p><p>Okay. Let’s raise the curtain and move on to the show. Please take your seats. The show is on.</p><p>Hellooooou.</p><p>Is there anyone in the world, who doesn’t think, “what life is all about?” “what do we want in life?”<br>In this blog post, I want to express armchair thoughts that came to me when I was thinking about “what do I want in life?”. (wait, some things could be ideas I read from books and others).</p><p>I did an exercise. If you want you can do this exercise too. I thought about that question, “What do I want in life now?” and wrote down on paper the things I have in mind to get or achieve in the future.</p><p>Let me tell you some of the things I wrote down. 😉</p><p>I may need a laptop with more specs.<br>A mobile phone with a good quality camera. (I’m not too fond of iPhones, by the way, I think they are overpriced and over-hyped, except for the new privacy feature.)<br>Maybe a house.<br>I may want to have a good healthy body.<br>Maybe a Nobel prize in physics 😜.<br>Maybe wealth and money.<br>I may want to be successful.<br>Maybe I want fame, just like Einstein and Newton has 🤔.</p><p>You may think my wishes are silly 🙂. But, I want to be truthful so that my shyness won’t skew my results. I think People have wishes like the ones I mentioned above. And you could be shy, or you may think that is stupid, just like I felt when I started to write them down 😳.<br>Maybe I want to be like Michael Jackson(I don’t mean dead 💀, I meant rockstar 🎸).<br>Maybe I want to be the one to achieve the most incredible thing or the one to solve the biggest mystery or a problem in the world? (Just like the alien scientist in the planet orbiting Bettleguese(it is a very interesting star, by the way), found the first evidence of extraterrestrial life in a blue planet in our solar system in 2020).<br>Maybe this is the one we seek “to invent time travel” ⏳? If this is the one thing that every human seek, then there is only one seat available? This makes so sad.</p><p>Okay. Suppose I get all of it. What would I do? What will I be?</p><p>Will I be seeking more things, even after I get all those things? Then I asked myself, “will I be happy?” even if I get all of that. Maybe not. We have seen many successful people being miserable. “What makes me happy?”.</p><p>Wait, this is weird. Why did I want to be happy?</p><p>Then I thought, why do I need those above things and why I wanted to seek those things? Maybe I want to proud and show others that ” I am a great man”.<br>Why do I want to show off to others and show myself as a great person? What will it bring to me?</p><p>Then after thinking more about that for almost an hour, by laying in the bed, with both hands wide open, looking into the abyss. I just realized I want to be happy. All those things just make me happy. That’s it. Nothing more.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://sensational-meerkat-2eb75c.netlify.app//content/images/2023/06/15w21b1o.png" class="kg-image" alt="HAPPINESS" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1471" srcset="https://sensational-meerkat-2eb75c.netlify.app//content/images/size/w600/2023/06/15w21b1o.png 600w, https://sensational-meerkat-2eb75c.netlify.app//content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/15w21b1o.png 1000w, https://sensational-meerkat-2eb75c.netlify.app//content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/15w21b1o.png 1600w, https://sensational-meerkat-2eb75c.netlify.app//content/images/2023/06/15w21b1o.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@yuyeunglau?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Yuyang Liu</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>So, my conclusion is, we humans want happiness (if not everyone, then at least I am 😅).</p><p>Me 1:OMG! This is so simple. I don’t think this is correct.<br>Me 2:wait a minute. Why things have to be complicated?<br>Me 1: Well, Life is something mysterious and complicated. Isn’t it?<br>Me 2: Maybe. .. . .. . . . .  Maybe not.</p><p>So, guys, I may be wrong, but I just want to think more about it.  I just shared a glimpse of my thought process. If you want to say anything, then you can say it to me. I would love to learn from others.</p><p>I believe we can only improve when we truly put ourselves without shame in the judgement of others so that we can know where we went wrong and where we are right. And what can we do to improve.</p><p>Curtains are dropping. The show is over. Once again, I would love your comments.</p><p>In my next post, I like to write my thoughts on “what is happiness?”.
