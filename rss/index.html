This happened at a cancer hospital when I was accompanying my grandmother at the hospital. </p><p>Let&apos;s move on.</p><p>The following happened at the end of January 2020. My Grandmother had Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. She is well now and recovered from cancer. At that time, she was undergoing chemotherapy at <strong>Adyar Cancer Institute, Chennai. </strong></p><p>Since my mother and father were working and I was free. I just accompanied my Grandmother to fix the date for chemotherapy and take some tests before that.<br>We came to the hospital at 9 am. There was a place with chairs for people to wait. It&apos;s like a waiting area, but it was almost open. We had a roof, but anybody can pass through that area.</p><p>In the afternoon, my Grandmother went to take a test. I decided to have my lunch.<br>Suddenly, a street dog approached me. The street dog was not like a stereotypical street dog depicted in movies, the lean and dirty. This dog was clean and healthy. I thought it is looking for my food. But I ignored it, thinking that it would go. But it didn&apos;t and tried to shoo it away. But it didn&apos;t move. To add some background, I am afraid of dogs. Even now, I would try to avoid dogs as much as possible, and I am 22 years old.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596601114285-57adf9901e23?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHN0cmVldCUyMGRvZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU4NTc3ODg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="A Happy Dog and a Girl with cancer" loading="lazy" width="3500" height="2139" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596601114285-57adf9901e23?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHN0cmVldCUyMGRvZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU4NTc3ODg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596601114285-57adf9901e23?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHN0cmVldCUyMGRvZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU4NTc3ODg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596601114285-57adf9901e23?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHN0cmVldCUyMGRvZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU4NTc3ODg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596601114285-57adf9901e23?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHN0cmVldCUyMGRvZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU4NTc3ODg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@iammrvamsi?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Mohan Vamsi</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Continuing, the dog didn&apos;t move from me. It just kept looking at me. I thought it would try to bark and jump to get food if I kept ignoring it. So, I moved to a new seat far from there. It followed me there.</p><p>By this time, my Grandmother me in the waiting area. She started to eat with me. She tried to shoo the dog away, but it didn&apos;t go away. Then she decided to give it some food. The food was prawn curry and rice. She went to the back of the waiting area. It had sand and stones. She put some food in a rock. The dog didn&apos;t eat. I was confused. What does the dog want? Maybe the dog didn&apos;t like prawns. It reminded me of the dogs in Madras Christian College. The dogs never eat rice, even if we give them. They will only eat if we provide them with meat. I know that from my personal experience.</p><p>So, the dog didn&apos;t eat. But it came to us again. I can&apos;t understand. It didn&apos;t like our food but keep on coming to us.</p><p>It wandered around us for another 15 minutes. After that, it moved to a young woman in a red chudithar with her mom. She was covering her head with a scarf. Her head was shaved. Most probably, She could be undergoing chemotherapy.<br>The dog did the same thing. It didn&apos;t move and kept looking at her. The girl saw the dog and said &quot;hey&quot; and brushed the dogs head and neck with her hand. She did that for five minutes while talking to her mom occasionally.</p><p>The dog sat beside her and laid on the ground, and went to blissful sleep. I could see that from the way it was relaxed and happy while sleeping.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579038144560-0cf69470be08?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fHNsZWVwaW5nJTIwZG9nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTg1NzkxNg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="A Happy Dog and a Girl with cancer" loading="lazy" width="3500" height="2336" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579038144560-0cf69470be08?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fHNsZWVwaW5nJTIwZG9nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTg1NzkxNg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579038144560-0cf69470be08?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fHNsZWVwaW5nJTIwZG9nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTg1NzkxNg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579038144560-0cf69470be08?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fHNsZWVwaW5nJTIwZG9nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTg1NzkxNg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579038144560-0cf69470be08?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDV8fHNsZWVwaW5nJTIwZG9nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTg1NzkxNg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@designbytholen?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">REGINE THOLEN</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I realised I was too dumb, and It just wanted love. I could have never guessed it.</p><p>This incident touched my heart. The girl would have been going through pain physically and emotionally due to cancer treatment. But she was not sad and showed love without hesitation.</p><p>The scene which I experienced created a conflict in me. I asked myself when was the last time I sought love and gave love to anything or anybody like that. Of course, my parents love me and love them. But the love I saw was blissful. The dog was blissful.</p><p>I was so fearful of the dog, but it never meant any harm to me.<br>The dog life was simple. It searches for food. I am pretty sure that the dog is getting enough food as it was very healthy. After food, it is searching for love. That&apos;s it. It never searches for anything else. It lives a content life with a content heart, not worrying about any other things in life. The dog was happy.</p><p><strong>What about my life?</strong> I have dreams; I am working for that. I am not perfect in that. Sometimes, I think I want to prove myself. But do I have a content heart? Am I happy? Am I blissful?</p><p>The dog never has any dreams, and it is blissful.<strong> Why I am not blissful?</strong><br>Our dreams and ambitions a curse?<br>What should I do to be content and happy?<br>I don&apos;t know. But I know I am seeking answers.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>What is the roadway to be content? Is being content important? Does happiness really matter? Yes, I think being content and happy is important. But what do we do for that? Does it really make us happy? A street dog can be content and happy with food and love. What does a human need to be content and happy?</p><p>What do you think the way to be content and happy? Leave it as comments.</p><p>If you have suggestions or want to get feedback on your posts.

The last blog explained what happiness is? This blog explains the advantage of knowing it and the way to realise it in our life. Why shouldn&apos;t we seek things for pleasure and enjoyment? What do we need to be happy? The above questions will be addressed in this blog.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><br>In the last blog, I try to explain my perspective on &quot;what is happiness&quot;. In this blog, I will explain how helpful the idea of happiness and emotions is in our lives. I will explain how I apply these ideologies in my life.<br>As we have seen, the happiness we get from objects is not true happiness, as it will only bring us unhappiness. There is another type of happiness called absolute happiness.<br>I want to explain more about the idea of absolute happiness<br>we found that happiness is a &#xA0;state of mind. I explained the concept of objective happiness. We saw that happiness from sensations are temporary and only make us miserable in the long run.<br>From now, I will explain the idea of absolute happiness. It is the state of mind which we experience when we are not dependent on objects for happiness. It is when we realise we never need something to be happy. For absolute happiness, we are dependent only on ourselves, not on any objects. Since absolute happiness is not dependent upon the objects and the sensation they produce, we will never be bored of it. We will always be happy when we realise that state of happiness, nothing in the world can make you sad.</p><h2 id="absolute-happiness">Absolute happiness</h2><p><br>How to be in a state of absolute happiness?<br>It is simple. We don&apos;t have to do anything else. We have to realise that it is within ourselves. As we have seen in the last blog, the happiness that we experience is produced by us. That implies we don&apos;t need anything to be happy. It is just a matter of choice. We can choose to be happy.<br>Nothing in the world can stop or screw you with happiness. Even you cannot screw yourself from that happiness. Each and everyone in the world has the choice of happiness, and nothing can take away that ability from us.<br>Did you remember the happiest moment in your life? We produce that, and it is within us. We never need anything to experience that state of happiness.<br>In the same way, as we know, every emotion is produced by our mind. This implies the strength we require to complete anything is within us. We don&apos;t need anything from external to make us get the force that is required. We can realise and become the force in a second if we want to since we are the creator of that strength.<br>So If you feel you can&apos;t do something, you can choose to have the strength needed to do something.</p><h2 id="emotions">Emotions</h2><p><br>Ever felt bored of something. The same interest you show in your favourite movie, you can show it in the book you are studying. Because you are the creator of the interest, and that interest is within you. You can choose to be interested in anything. Nothing is needed for you to do that. Nothing can stop you from that. Knowing this can change your life. It has changed my life. Nothing is distasteful anymore.</p><h2 id="impact-on-my-life">Impact on my life</h2><p><br>How it changed my life?<br>When I realised that happiness is within me, my actions were changed. Because I always have the power of choice within me.<br></p><h2 id="power-of-choice">Power of choice</h2><p><br>If I have few weeks before the board exam, If my friends asked me to join them on the beach. Since I know that happiness is within me, I choose to study rather than the beach.<br>I read even the boring subjects with interest.<br>The vegetable I used to love became par with the vegetables I used to hate. Every taste became equal.<br>My grades improved. My health improved. Even my performance in sports improved. I understood I never depend on anything to improve in my life. Nobody can give or take away anything for me to change something.<br>Now, I am happy with myself.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579458342405-52d7d969e0d4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGJyZWFraW5nJTIwY2hhaW58ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI1NjAyMDc4&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Happiness is within you |The secret to being happy" loading="lazy" width="4288" height="2848" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579458342405-52d7d969e0d4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGJyZWFraW5nJTIwY2hhaW58ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI1NjAyMDc4&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579458342405-52d7d969e0d4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGJyZWFraW5nJTIwY2hhaW58ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI1NjAyMDc4&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579458342405-52d7d969e0d4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGJyZWFraW5nJTIwY2hhaW58ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI1NjAyMDc4&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579458342405-52d7d969e0d4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGJyZWFraW5nJTIwY2hhaW58ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI1NjAyMDc4&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aidamarie_photography?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Aida L</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="seeking-happiness-outside">Seeking happiness outside</h2><p><br>We are just confused that we will be happy when we get things. No, we will never be satisfied from getting something. The wealthiest person in the world can be miserable. We have seen that many times.<br>There is a problem with seeking happiness outside. If we seek happiness from the outside, we will be only miserable because we do things to be happy, but as time goes on, we will realise we are not satisfied and will be tired of doing that to be happy. So, we should never seek happiness, even other emotions like strength, interest outside. It is within us. We have to seek inside.<br>Realise, You don&apos;t have to be successful or have a good job to be happy.<br>No drug can make you happy, and no drug can stop you from being happy.<br>No wine is needed to be happy, and nothing can stop you from being happy other than you.<br>No wealth and money can bring you happiness, and no wealth and money can stop you from being happy.<br>You don&apos;t have to holy to be happy. Neither you have to be sinful.<br>You don&apos;t have to be educated to be happy. Neither you have to be uneducated.</p><h2 id="the-simplicity">The simplicity</h2><p><br>The knowledge behind being is so simple. Anybody can learn it, and they may need minutes to know that. The knowledge is, we don&apos;t need anything, or any action is not needed.

Nor you can attain it by doing or achieving a thing.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><br>Happiness is within ourselves. So does interest and strength. There is nothing you should do to realise that. No object is needed to be happy or strong or interested. You have it within you. You can have it by choosing to have it.</p><h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2><p><br>If we know that happy is within ourselves, we will never be unhappy. If we know interest is within ourselves, we don&apos;t wait for something to happen to make us interested in anything. You will never be disinterested. If we know strength is within ourselves. We will never be weak.</p><p>What do you think of my post? Do you think these ideas are too superficial or clear? Do you think it is complicated and not practical?

We first try to analyze the origin of happiness. Then we try to explore its true nature.</p><p>In the last blog, I have written about &quot;<a href="https://sathishkannan162.github.io/what-do-i-want-in-life/">what do we want in life?</a>&quot;. In the previous blog, I concluded that everything we do in life has an ultimate motive: to be happy. Link to my last blog: <a href="https://sathishkannan162.github.io/what-do-i-want-in-life/">what-do-i-want-in-life</a>?</p><p>In this blog, we will go over another crucial question, &quot;<strong>What is happiness?</strong>&quot;. Isn&apos;t it a silly thing to ask? We experience and seek it throughout our life. But experiencing something and knowing something are very two different things. We see the light, but knowing what light is, is another thing.</p><h2 id="why-is-the-question-so-important">Why is the question so important?</h2><p>In the movie &quot;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the galaxy</a>&quot;, the hyperdimensional beings build a supercomputer to find the answer to the question &quot;What is the ultimate meaning of our life?&quot;. The conversation went as follows.</p><p><strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;:</strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; We want to know the answer to the ultimate question. <strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;:</strong> Well, what is the ultimate question? &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; <strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;:</strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Don&apos;t you know, it is &quot;The Ultimate Question&quot;. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; <strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;</strong>: &#xA0;I don&apos;t know the ultimate question. Can you say it? &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; <strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;:</strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; What is the meaning of all of this? The meaning of our life. <strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;</strong>: Ok. Meet me in a million years. I will compute the answer to the question. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Then the hyper beings went to the supercomputer after a million years. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;</strong>: &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Have you found the answer. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;</strong>: Yeah. The answer was 43. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; The supercomputer explained that they didn&apos;t define the question well. The supercomputer said, &quot;Questions are important than answers. Without right questions, one cannot find the required answer.&quot; Then the computer said it would create another computer to find the question. I don&apos;t want to spoil the surprise. If you wish, you can watch the movie.</p><p>So, it is more important to understand and define the question correctly to find the answer. Hence, to know &quot;how to be happy?&quot; We have to know &quot;what is happiness?&quot;.</p><h2 id="how-is-happiness-produced">How is happiness produced?</h2><p>How to find out, what is happiness? The scientific thing to do is analyze its properties and origin and try the best possible explanation we can deduct from the facts. So, first, let us try to understand how it is produced? From a scientific perspective, I can say that a part of the brain is more stimulated when we are happy. So, stimulation in a particular part of the brain produces happiness. So, to be happy, we have to stimulate a specific part of the brain.</p><p>How could we do that? I have an idea, we can attach some electrodes to our brain, and we can be happy all the time. </p><p>But it is a bad idea. Not because we don&apos;t have the technology yet. But we will drop dead just by doing that thing and being happy. We need to function for the sustenance of us and the world.</p><h2 id="source-of-happiness">Source of happiness</h2><p>Lets analyze again . Let us try to understand the source of happiness by finding things that make us happy and the process of keeping us happy.</p><h3 id="tangible-source">Tangible Source</h3><p>Let us consider a situation. Let us consider ice cream&#x1F367;. We all like ice cream. But if you are an adult, you may have some more important worries than ice cream, and they make you happy more than ice cream. You can also consider them instead of the ice cream and alter the analysis according to the worries. But I believe the conclusion will be the same.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="What is happiness? | An analysis" loading="lazy" width="5760" height="3840" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brookelark?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Brooke Lark</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We give ice cream to a child.

So, the sensation created by the object(ice cream) is the cause of happiness for the child.</p><h3 id="intangible-source">Intangible Source</h3><p>Let us consider another case. We will be happy when somebody shows love&#x1F495; for us. So the sensation created by an abstract object is the source of happiness.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="What is happiness? | An analysis" loading="lazy" width="4973" height="3693" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jamie452?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jamie Street</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>So, the source of happiness is the objects (both tangible and intangible).</p><p>But we found the sources of happiness. But what is happiness? It is nothing but a state of mind that we go to when we experience the sensation. By the same way of thought, we can realize that every emotion we experience has the source as sensation, and they are a state of mind.</p><h2 id="objective-happinesstemporary-and-changing">Objective happiness - temporary and changing</h2><p>But what if we give two more ice creams to the same child. Will he be happy after eating the two ice creams? If he is happy after that, then give him ten more. After a certain point, he will start to hate it. So, the object that gave him happiness is now giving him sadness. If we think more about it, every object does the same. The happiness we get from objects is temporary and changing. We grow bored of any object.</p><p>Though we get bored of a single object. After we get bored of the object, we go to other objects for happiness, but we will get bored of it too, and we will be restless and unhappy and chasing behind objects (both tangible and intangible) for happiness.</p><p>You may also like this example, In a famous Tamil movie &quot;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139861/">Arunachalam</a>&quot;, in a scene, the hero&apos;s father wants his son to stop smoking. So he made him smoke for 24 hours. He grew tired of it and quit smoking. Now, the hero uses the same trick on his son. The hero wants his son to spend 30 crores in 30 days to inherit the wealth from him.</p><h2 id="the-insatiable-hunger">The insatiable hunger</h2><p>The reality of objective happiness is it is like an insatiable hunger. We can never get full. We will always want more. We think if we pour water into a vase, it will eventually get full. It will never become full because it has a black hole at the bottom of it (or a bottomless vase). This is true for bad things like drugs, alcohol. It is also true for good things like kindness, knowledge and education.</p><p>So, what is my final idea? Happiness is a state of mind. But is happiness a devil that keeps us chasing a rupee note and never make it reach us? Yes and No. Happiness can be a bliss, when we understand the idea of absolute happiness, that is different from the idea of objective happiness. In my next blog, I will explain, &quot;How we can be happy?&quot; and the idea of &quot;Absolute Happiness&quot;. You must read the blog to understand my whole argument. Would you please not stop here? It will not make much sense.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Happiness is a state of mind. Objective happiness is produced from sensations from tangible and intangible objects. Objective happiness is an insatiable hunger, and going behind objective happiness will only make you an insatiable maniac. It is temporary and changing. This is true for alcohol and drugs, and it is also true for empathy, intelligence and kindness.</p><p>Link to my next blog: <a href="https://sathishkannan162.github.io/happiness-is-within-you/">Happiness is within you</a></p><p>If you have suggestions or want to get feedback on your posts.

But, unfortunately, I still can&apos;t find the answer.<br>I tried many things. Sometimes, I used to sit alone for hours just thinking? What could be the answer? But still no. Sometimes I used to put a tantrum with myself to find the answer. But still no.</p><p>Okay. Let&apos;s raise the curtain and move on to the show. Please take your seats. The show is on.</p><p>Hellooooou.</p><p>Is there anyone in the world, who doesn&apos;t think, &quot;what life is all about?&quot; &quot;what do we want in life?&quot;<br>In this blog post, I want to express armchair thoughts that came to me when I was thinking about &quot;what do I want in life?&quot;. (wait, some things could be ideas I read from books and others).</p><p>I did an exercise. If you want you can do this exercise too. I thought about that question, &quot;What do I want in life now?&quot; and wrote down on paper the things I have in mind to get or achieve in the future.</p><p>Let me tell you some of the things I wrote down. &#x1F609;</p><p>I may need a laptop with more specs.<br>A mobile phone with a good quality camera. (I&apos;m not too fond of iPhones, by the way, I think they are overpriced and over-hyped, except for the new privacy feature.)<br>Maybe a house.<br>I may want to have a good healthy body.<br>Maybe a Nobel prize in physics &#x1F61C;.<br>Maybe wealth and money.<br>I may want to be successful.<br>Maybe I want fame, just like Einstein and Newton has &#x1F914;.</p><p>You may think my wishes are silly &#x1F642;. But, I want to be truthful so that my shyness won&apos;t skew my results. I think People have wishes like the ones I mentioned above. And you could be shy, or you may think that is stupid, just like I felt when I started to write them down &#x1F633;.<br>Maybe I want to be like Michael Jackson(I don&apos;t mean dead &#x1F480;, I meant rockstar &#x1F3B8;).<br>Maybe I want to be the one to achieve the most incredible thing or the one to solve the biggest mystery or a problem in the world? (Just like the alien scientist in the planet orbiting Bettleguese(it is a very interesting star, by the way), found the first evidence of extraterrestrial life in a blue planet in our solar system in 2020).<br>Maybe this is the one we seek &quot;to invent time travel&quot; &#x23F3;? If this is the one thing that every human seek, then there is only one seat available? This makes so sad.</p><p>Okay. Suppose I get all of it. What would I do? What will I be?</p><p>Will I be seeking more things, even after I get all those things? Then I asked myself, &quot;will I be happy?&quot; even if I get all of that. Maybe not. We have seen many successful people being miserable. &quot;What makes me happy?&quot;.</p><p>Wait, this is weird. Why did I want to be happy?</p><p>Then I thought, why do I need those above things and why I wanted to seek those things? Maybe I want to proud and show others that &quot; I am a great man&quot;.<br>Why do I want to show off to others and show myself as a great person? What will it bring to me?</p><p>Then after thinking more about that for almost an hour, by laying in the bed, with both hands wide open, looking into the abyss. I just realized I want to be happy. All those things just make me happy. That&apos;s it. Nothing more.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="What do I want in life? &#x1F607;|My logical reasoning" loading="lazy" width="6016" height="4016" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dani_franco?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Cristian Newman</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p><br>So, my conclusion is, we humans want happiness (if not everyone, then at least I am &#x1F605;).</p><p>Me 1:OMG!

It was about t-statistics &#x1F913;. &#xA0;A thought came to my mind about applying t-statistics to trend price of a stock and, in turn, make some sweet money&#x1F911;. Since I am going to have end semester exams soon in 2-3 days. It is on my bucket list for this summer.</p><p>Then this crazy idea hit me. Let&apos;s assume there is a gambling&#x1F3B2; game. The rules of the game are I can choose head or tail. More clearly, I can bet my money&#x1F4B2; on head or tail. Then a coin is tossed. If I get it right, then my money would double. If I lose, then my money would be gone.</p><p>This is my idea. I would bet, say, 100 in the head. If I win, I will take the 200, then I will bet 100 in head or tail according to my wish. Here is where things get a little interesting. If I lose, then I would bet 200 on the head again. Because the probability that I am going to get tail twice in succession is 1/4. Hence the probability of me winning is 3/4. Most probably, I will win now and go out with 400, that is 100 in profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money &#x1F4B8;| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="5616" height="3744" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sharonmccutcheon?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Sharon McCutcheon</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even if I lose the 2nd time. I would bet 800 on the head again. The probability of winning is 7/8 now. If I win now, I will walk away with 100 in profit in total. Even if I lose the 3rd time, I will double my bet as long as I want. In the end, I would always end up with 100 in profit. Cool!&#x1F60E; Right? I found the infinite money glitch&#x1F4B8;&#x2014;no more worries for the rest of my life.</p><p>Now, I decided to test my theory, but I didn&apos;t want to risk real money. I knew about the binary options in the Olymp trade&#x1F4C8;. In which, you have to predict whether the price of a specific stock will be greaterup or less than the current price after a specific amount of time. If I win, I will get up to 82% to 10% of the money I have placed. To increase my chance of making a profit, since I wouldn&apos;t get 100% of the money I placed. I decided to triple the betting amount If I lose. This would significantly increase my profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money &#x1F4B8;| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="3999" height="2666" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Markus Winkler</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I downloaded the app&#x1F4F1;. They have a demo account, where we can learn binary options trading using demo money. I started trading. Since stock price is set by everyday people like me who are trading. They would be random, they have an equal probability of going up or down(50-50 probability).</p><p>I started trading. I just started with 10 demo dollars. To my surprise, I doubled my money within 24 trades. Just kidding&#x1F61C;. I lost all my demo money which was 10,000, after trading 10-15 times. . This sounds wrong. Maybe the app is biased and just try to scam money from people.</p><p>I realised this is not app&apos;s fault. It is my fault. I made an error in my calculations. I assumed that since the chance of something happening in succession is less, I have a good chance of winning. But when I do it over several times, the chance of me losing in succession (ex: getting tails in succession) at least once becomes larger. For example, the chance of getting two heads in succession in two throws is 1/4, but if I make four such throws, the chance of it happening at least one time is quite high. So, I would lose the second time, if I do that large number of times. Then you may say that just double the bet for the third time. If I lose again, then you would say, double the bet the fourth time.</p><p>But here is the problem. I assumed that there is no cap to the betting amount in reality, but I am wrong. Since I double or triple my bet amount every time I lose, the amount escalates quickly to a huge number. For example, if I started with 10 and tripled the bet amount every time. Then in the second bet, it would be 30, then 90,270,810, 2430, then 8290. If I lose that, I will lose all my money in my demo account. So, the max cap of money I have and the increasing probability when I do it many times say that I would lose all my money in the end. Luckily that was a demo account.</p><p>So, the takeaway for me is a small mistake in mathematics can cost you so much if you are not careful. I learned from my mistake. But I am going to apply t-statistic to the trend price of the stock in the summer.

I created along with two of my friends a whatsapp group called <strong>study club</strong>, where we would share our ideas, and even our progress. This made me somewhat accountable to them. As time went on, I found that the club thrived (though sometimes we stopped it totally) in the long run. I also found that my relationship with them also improved and I started to learn from them more than what I was giving away. </p><p>Two days ago, <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/"><strong>Ali Abdaal </strong></a>(youtuber) tweeted asking for ideas for his next video on making a personal website. I shared my idea of hosting a ghost.org website with github pages. In this way, we don&apos;t need to pay any hosting cost and I suggested that it would be a boon for students who are starting it out. That comment got so much likes, and people commented asking for resources to do that. This made me realize, people really need &#xA0;this kind of stuff. Also, I realized &quot;something I thought to be simple &#x1F913;, may not be so simple to others, who are beginners&quot;. </p><p>Also, I found that sharing our work help us to get valuable feedback, which could totally change the work we are doing. No more days of spending days on a project, which is illogical but somehow our brain&#x1F9E0; couldn&apos;t catch that. </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
