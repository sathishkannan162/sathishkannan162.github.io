We first try to analyze the origin of happiness. Then we try to explore its true nature.</p><p>In the last blog, I have written about &quot;<a href="https://sathishkannan162.github.io/what-do-i-want-in-life/">what do we want in life?</a>&quot;. In the previous blog, I concluded that everything we do in life has an ultimate motive: to be happy. Link to my last blog: <a href="https://sathishkannan162.github.io/what-do-i-want-in-life/">what-do-i-want-in-life</a>?</p><p>In this blog, we will go over another crucial question, &quot;<strong>What is happiness?</strong>&quot;. Isn&apos;t it a silly thing to ask? We experience and seek it throughout our life. But experiencing something and knowing something are very two different things. We see the light, but knowing what light is, is another thing.</p><h2 id="why-is-the-question-so-important">Why is the question so important?</h2><p>In the movie &quot;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the galaxy</a>&quot;, the hyperdimensional beings build a supercomputer to find the answer to the question &quot;What is the ultimate meaning of our life?&quot;. The conversation went as follows.</p><p><strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;:</strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; We want to know the answer to the ultimate question. <strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;:</strong> Well, what is the ultimate question? &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; <strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;:</strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; Don&apos;t you know, it is &quot;The Ultimate Question&quot;. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; <strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;</strong>: &#xA0;I don&apos;t know the ultimate question. Can you say it? &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; <strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;:</strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; What is the meaning of all of this? The meaning of our life. <strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;</strong>: Ok. Meet me in a million years. I will compute the answer to the question. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Then the hyper beings went to the supercomputer after a million years. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<strong>Hyper beings&#x1F47D;</strong>: &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Have you found the answer. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<strong>Supercomputer&#x1F4BB;</strong>: Yeah. The answer was 43. &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; The supercomputer explained that they didn&apos;t define the question well. The supercomputer said, &quot;Questions are important than answers. Without right questions, one cannot find the required answer.&quot; Then the computer said it would create another computer to find the question. I don&apos;t want to spoil the surprise. If you wish, you can watch the movie.</p><p>So, it is more important to understand and define the question correctly to find the answer. Hence, to know &quot;how to be happy?&quot; We have to know &quot;what is happiness?&quot;.</p><h2 id="how-is-happiness-produced">How is happiness produced?</h2><p>How to find out, what is happiness? The scientific thing to do is analyze its properties and origin and try the best possible explanation we can deduct from the facts. So, first, let us try to understand how it is produced? From a scientific perspective, I can say that a part of the brain is more stimulated when we are happy. So, stimulation in a particular part of the brain produces happiness. So, to be happy, we have to stimulate a specific part of the brain.</p><p>How could we do that? I have an idea, we can attach some electrodes to our brain, and we can be happy all the time. </p><p>But it is a bad idea. Not because we don&apos;t have the technology yet. But we will drop dead just by doing that thing and being happy. We need to function for the sustenance of us and the world.</p><h2 id="source-of-happiness">Source of happiness</h2><p>Lets analyze again . Let us try to understand the source of happiness by finding things that make us happy and the process of keeping us happy.</p><h3 id="tangible-source">Tangible Source</h3><p>Let us consider a situation. Let us consider ice cream&#x1F367;. We all like ice cream. But if you are an adult, you may have some more important worries than ice cream, and they make you happy more than ice cream. You can also consider them instead of the ice cream and alter the analysis according to the worries. But I believe the conclusion will be the same.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="What is happiness? | An analysis" loading="lazy" width="5760" height="3840" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501443762994-82bd5dace89a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGljZSUyMGNyZWFtfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTc0Nw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brookelark?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Brooke Lark</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We give ice cream to a child. It will be tasty. He will eat it, and he will be happy. So, the sensation created by the object(ice cream) is the cause of happiness for the child.</p><h3 id="intangible-source">Intangible Source</h3><p>Let us consider another case. We will be happy when somebody shows love&#x1F495; for us. So the sensation created by an abstract object is the source of happiness.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="What is happiness? | An analysis" loading="lazy" width="4973" height="3693" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515871204537-49a5fe66a31f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE2fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTM1MTgwNw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jamie452?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jamie Street</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>So, the source of happiness is the objects (both tangible and intangible).</p><p>But we found the sources of happiness. But what is happiness? It is nothing but a state of mind that we go to when we experience the sensation. By the same way of thought, we can realize that every emotion we experience has the source as sensation, and they are a state of mind.</p><h2 id="objective-happinesstemporary-and-changing">Objective happiness - temporary and changing</h2><p>But what if we give two more ice creams to the same child. Will he be happy after eating the two ice creams? If he is happy after that, then give him ten more. After a certain point, he will start to hate it. So, the object that gave him happiness is now giving him sadness. If we think more about it, every object does the same. The happiness we get from objects is temporary and changing. We grow bored of any object.</p><p>Though we get bored of a single object. After we get bored of the object, we go to other objects for happiness, but we will get bored of it too, and we will be restless and unhappy and chasing behind objects (both tangible and intangible) for happiness.</p><p>You may also like this example, In a famous Tamil movie &quot;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139861/">Arunachalam</a>&quot;, in a scene, the hero&apos;s father wants his son to stop smoking. So he made him smoke for 24 hours. He grew tired of it and quit smoking. Now, the hero uses the same trick on his son. The hero wants his son to spend 30 crores in 30 days to inherit the wealth from him.</p><h2 id="the-insatiable-hunger">The insatiable hunger</h2><p>The reality of objective happiness is it is like an insatiable hunger. We can never get full. We will always want more. We think if we pour water into a vase, it will eventually get full. It will never become full because it has a black hole at the bottom of it (or a bottomless vase). This is true for bad things like drugs, alcohol. It is also true for good things like kindness, knowledge and education.</p><p>So, what is my final idea? Happiness is a state of mind. But is happiness a devil that keeps us chasing a rupee note and never make it reach us? Yes and No. Happiness can be a bliss, when we understand the idea of absolute happiness, that is different from the idea of objective happiness. In my next blog, I will explain, &quot;How we can be happy?&quot; and the idea of &quot;Absolute Happiness&quot;. You must read the blog to understand my whole argument. Would you please not stop here? It will not make much sense.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Happiness is a state of mind. Objective happiness is produced from sensations from tangible and intangible objects. Objective happiness is an insatiable hunger, and going behind objective happiness will only make you an insatiable maniac. It is temporary and changing. This is true for alcohol and drugs, and it is also true for empathy, intelligence and kindness.</p><p>Link to my next blog: <a href="localhost:2368/how-to-be-happy/">How to be happy?</a></p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Guys, these ideas I shared have some relation to Advaita Vedanta, which is one of the many schools of Hinduism, which is based on logical reasoning to understand life. I don&apos;t fully know the school of thought. Also, I don&apos;t fully support Advaita Vedanta.

But, unfortunately, I still can&apos;t find the answer.<br>I tried many things. Sometimes, I used to sit alone for hours just thinking? What could be the answer? But still no. Sometimes I used to put a tantrum with myself to find the answer. But still no.</p><p>Okay. Let&apos;s raise the curtain and move on to the show. Please take your seats. The show is on.</p><p>Hellooooou.</p><p>Is there anyone in the world, who doesn&apos;t think, &quot;what life is all about?&quot; &quot;what do we want in life?&quot;<br>In this blog post, I want to express armchair thoughts that came to me when I was thinking about &quot;what do I want in life?&quot;. (wait, some things could be ideas I read from books and others).</p><p>I did an exercise. If you want you can do this exercise too. I thought about that question, &quot;What do I want in life now?&quot; and wrote down on paper the things I have in mind to get or achieve in the future.</p><p>Let me tell you some of the things I wrote down. &#x1F609;</p><p>I may need a laptop with more specs.<br>A mobile phone with a good quality camera. (I&apos;m not too fond of iPhones, by the way, I think they are overpriced and over-hyped, except for the new privacy feature.)<br>Maybe a house.<br>I may want to have a good healthy body.<br>Maybe a Nobel prize in physics &#x1F61C;.<br>Maybe wealth and money.<br>I may want to be successful.<br>Maybe I want fame, just like Einstein and Newton has &#x1F914;.</p><p>You may think my wishes are silly &#x1F642;. But, I want to be truthful so that my shyness won&apos;t skew my results. I think People have wishes like the ones I mentioned above. And you could be shy, or you may think that is stupid, just like I felt when I started to write them down &#x1F633;.<br>Maybe I want to be like Michael Jackson(I don&apos;t mean dead &#x1F480;, I meant rockstar &#x1F3B8;).<br>Maybe I want to be the one to achieve the most incredible thing or the one to solve the biggest mystery or a problem in the world? (Just like the alien scientist in the planet orbiting Bettleguese(it is a very interesting star, by the way), found the first evidence of extraterrestrial life in a blue planet in our solar system in 2020).<br>Maybe this is the one we seek &quot;to invent time travel&quot; &#x23F3;? If this is the one thing that every human seek, then there is only one seat available? This makes so sad.</p><p>Okay. Suppose I get all of it. What would I do? What will I be?</p><p>Will I be seeking more things, even after I get all those things? Then I asked myself, &quot;will I be happy?&quot; even if I get all of that. Maybe not. We have seen many successful people being miserable. &quot;What makes me happy?&quot;.</p><p>Wait, this is weird. Why did I want to be happy?</p><p>Then I thought, why do I need those above things and why I wanted to seek those things? Maybe I want to proud and show others that &quot; I am a great man&quot;.<br>Why do I want to show off to others and show myself as a great person? What will it bring to me?</p><p>Then after thinking more about that for almost an hour, by laying in the bed, with both hands wide open, looking into the abyss. I just realized I want to be happy.

It was about t-statistics &#x1F913;. &#xA0;A thought came to my mind about applying t-statistics to trend price of a stock and, in turn, make some sweet money&#x1F911;. Since I am going to have end semester exams soon in 2-3 days. It is on my bucket list for this summer.</p><p>Then this crazy idea hit me. Let&apos;s assume there is a gambling&#x1F3B2; game. The rules of the game are I can choose head or tail. More clearly, I can bet my money&#x1F4B2; on head or tail. Then a coin is tossed. If I get it right, then my money would double. If I lose, then my money would be gone.</p><p>This is my idea. I would bet, say, 100 in the head. If I win, I will take the 200, then I will bet 100 in head or tail according to my wish. Here is where things get a little interesting. If I lose, then I would bet 200 on the head again. Because the probability that I am going to get tail twice in succession is 1/4. Hence the probability of me winning is 3/4. Most probably, I will win now and go out with 400, that is 100 in profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money &#x1F4B8;| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="5616" height="3744" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sharonmccutcheon?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Sharon McCutcheon</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even if I lose the 2nd time. I would bet 800 on the head again. The probability of winning is 7/8 now. If I win now, I will walk away with 100 in profit in total. Even if I lose the 3rd time, I will double my bet as long as I want. In the end, I would always end up with 100 in profit. Cool!&#x1F60E; Right? I found the infinite money glitch&#x1F4B8;&#x2014;no more worries for the rest of my life.</p><p>Now, I decided to test my theory, but I didn&apos;t want to risk real money. I knew about the binary options in the Olymp trade&#x1F4C8;. In which, you have to predict whether the price of a specific stock will be greaterup or less than the current price after a specific amount of time. If I win, I will get up to 82% to 10% of the money I have placed. To increase my chance of making a profit, since I wouldn&apos;t get 100% of the money I placed. I decided to triple the betting amount If I lose. This would significantly increase my profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money &#x1F4B8;| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="3999" height="2666" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Markus Winkler</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I downloaded the app&#x1F4F1;. They have a demo account, where we can learn binary options trading using demo money. I started trading. Since stock price is set by everyday people like me who are trading. They would be random, they have an equal probability of going up or down(50-50 probability).</p><p>I started trading. I just started with 10 demo dollars. To my surprise, I doubled my money within 24 trades. Just kidding&#x1F61C;. I lost all my demo money which was 10,000, after trading 10-15 times. . This sounds wrong. Maybe the app is biased and just try to scam money from people.</p><p>I realised this is not app&apos;s fault. It is my fault. I made an error in my calculations. I assumed that since the chance of something happening in succession is less, I have a good chance of winning. But when I do it over several times, the chance of me losing in succession (ex: getting tails in succession) at least once becomes larger. For example, the chance of getting two heads in succession in two throws is 1/4, but if I make four such throws, the chance of it happening at least one time is quite high. So, I would lose the second time, if I do that large number of times. Then you may say that just double the bet for the third time. If I lose again, then you would say, double the bet the fourth time.</p><p>But here is the problem. I assumed that there is no cap to the betting amount in reality, but I am wrong. Since I double or triple my bet amount every time I lose, the amount escalates quickly to a huge number. For example, if I started with 10 and tripled the bet amount every time. Then in the second bet, it would be 30, then 90,270,810, 2430, then 8290. If I lose that, I will lose all my money in my demo account. So, the max cap of money I have and the increasing probability when I do it many times say that I would lose all my money in the end. Luckily that was a demo account.</p><p>So, the takeaway for me is a small mistake in mathematics can cost you so much if you are not careful. I learned from my mistake. But I am going to apply t-statistic to the trend price of the stock in the summer.

I created along with two of my friends a whatsapp group called <strong>study club</strong>, where we would share our ideas, and even our progress. This made me somewhat accountable to them. As time went on, I found that the club thrived (though sometimes we stopped it totally) in the long run. I also found that my relationship with them also improved and I started to learn from them more than what I was giving away. </p><p>Two days ago, <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/"><strong>Ali Abdaal </strong></a>(youtuber) tweeted asking for ideas for his next video on making a personal website. I shared my idea of hosting a ghost.org website with github pages. In this way, we don&apos;t need to pay any hosting cost and I suggested that it would be a boon for students who are starting it out. That comment got so much likes, and people commented asking for resources to do that. This made me realize, people really need &#xA0;this kind of stuff. Also, I realized &quot;something I thought to be simple &#x1F913;, may not be so simple to others, who are beginners&quot;. </p><p>Also, I found that sharing our work help us to get valuable feedback, which could totally change the work we are doing. No more days of spending days on a project, which is illogical but somehow our brain&#x1F9E0; couldn&apos;t catch that. </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
