But, unfortunately, I still can&apos;t find the answer.<br>I tried many things. Sometimes, I used to sit alone for hours just thinking? What could be the answer? But still no. Sometimes I used to put a tantrum with myself to find the answer. But still no.</p><p>Okay. Let&apos;s raise the curtain and move on to the show. Please take your seats. The show is on.</p><p>Hellooooou.</p><p>Is there anyone in the world, who doesn&apos;t think, &quot;what life is all about?&quot; &quot;what do we want in life?&quot;<br>In this blog post, I want to express armchair thoughts that came to me when I was thinking about &quot;what do I want in life?&quot;. (wait, some things could be ideas I read from books and others).</p><p>I did an exercise. If you want you can do this exercise too. I thought about that question, &quot;What do I want in life now?&quot; and wrote down on paper the things I have in mind to get or achieve in the future.</p><p>Let me tell you some of the things I wrote down. &#x1F609;</p><p>I may need a laptop with more specs.<br>A mobile phone with a good quality camera. (I&apos;m not too fond of iPhones, by the way, I think they are overpriced and over-hyped, except for the new privacy feature.)<br>Maybe a house.<br>I may want to have a good healthy body.<br>Maybe a Nobel prize in physics &#x1F61C;.<br>Maybe wealth and money.<br>I may want to be successful.<br>Maybe I want fame, just like Einstein and Newton has &#x1F914;.</p><p>You may think my wishes are silly &#x1F642;. But, I want to be truthful so that my shyness won&apos;t skew my results. I think People have wishes like the ones I mentioned above. And you could be shy, or you may think that is stupid, just like I felt when I started to write them down &#x1F633;.<br>Maybe I want to be like Michael Jackson(I don&apos;t mean dead &#x1F480;, I meant rockstar &#x1F3B8;).<br>Maybe I want to be the one to achieve the most incredible thing or the one to solve the biggest mystery or a problem in the world? (Just like the alien scientist in the planet orbiting Bettleguese(it is a very interesting star, by the way), found the first evidence of extraterrestrial life in a blue planet in our solar system in 2020).<br>Maybe this is the one we seek &quot;to invent time travel&quot; &#x23F3;? If this is the one thing that every human seek, then there is only one seat available? This makes so sad.</p><p>Okay. Suppose I get all of it. What would I do? What will I be?</p><p>Will I be seeking more things, even after I get all those things? Then I asked myself, &quot;will I be happy?&quot; even if I get all of that. Maybe not. We have seen many successful people being miserable. &quot;What makes me happy?&quot;.</p><p>Wait, this is weird. Why did I want to be happy?</p><p>Then I thought, why do I need those above things and why I wanted to seek those things? Maybe I want to proud and show others that &quot; I am a great man&quot;.<br>Why do I want to show off to others and show myself as a great person? What will it bring to me?</p><p>Then after thinking more about that for almost an hour, by laying in the bed, with both hands wide open, looking into the abyss. I just realized I want to be happy. All those things just make me happy. That&apos;s it. Nothing more.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="What do I want in life? &#x1F607;|My logical reasoning" loading="lazy" width="6016" height="4016" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493315903406-452ced366e0a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxsYXlpbmclMjBkb3dufGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk1MTAzOA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dani_franco?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Cristian Newman</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p><br>So, my conclusion is, we humans want happiness (if not everyone, then at least I am &#x1F605;).</p><p>Me 1:OMG!

Isn&apos;t it?<br>Me 2: Maybe. .. . .. . . . . &#xA0;Maybe not.</p><p>So, guys, I may be wrong, but I just want to think more about it. &#xA0;I just shared a glimpse of my thought process. If you want to say anything, then you can say it to me. I would love to learn from others.</p><p>I believe we can only improve when we truly put ourselves without shame in the judgement of others so that we can know where we went wrong and where we are right. And what can we do to improve.</p><p>Curtains are dropping. The show is over. Once again, I would love your comments.</p><p>In my next post, I like to write my thoughts on &quot;what is happiness?&quot;.

It was about t-statistics &#x1F913;. &#xA0;A thought came to my mind about applying t-statistics to trend price of a stock and, in turn, make some sweet money&#x1F911;. Since I am going to have end semester exams soon in 2-3 days. It is on my bucket list for this summer.</p><p>Then this crazy idea hit me. Let&apos;s assume there is a gambling&#x1F3B2; game. The rules of the game are I can choose head or tail. More clearly, I can bet my money&#x1F4B2; on head or tail. Then a coin is tossed. If I get it right, then my money would double. If I lose, then my money would be gone.</p><p>This is my idea. I would bet, say, 100 in the head. If I win, I will take the 200, then I will bet 100 in head or tail according to my wish. Here is where things get a little interesting. If I lose, then I would bet 200 on the head again. Because the probability that I am going to get tail twice in succession is 1/4. Hence the probability of me winning is 3/4. Most probably, I will win now and go out with 400, that is 100 in profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money &#x1F4B8;| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="5616" height="3744" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sharonmccutcheon?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Sharon McCutcheon</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even if I lose the 2nd time. I would bet 800 on the head again. The probability of winning is 7/8 now. If I win now, I will walk away with 100 in profit in total. Even if I lose the 3rd time, I will double my bet as long as I want. In the end, I would always end up with 100 in profit. Cool!&#x1F60E; Right? I found the infinite money glitch&#x1F4B8;&#x2014;no more worries for the rest of my life.</p><p>Now, I decided to test my theory, but I didn&apos;t want to risk real money. I knew about the binary options in the Olymp trade&#x1F4C8;. In which, you have to predict whether the price of a specific stock will be greaterup or less than the current price after a specific amount of time. If I win, I will get up to 82% to 10% of the money I have placed. To increase my chance of making a profit, since I wouldn&apos;t get 100% of the money I placed. I decided to triple the betting amount If I lose. This would significantly increase my profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money &#x1F4B8;| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="3999" height="2666" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Markus Winkler</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I downloaded the app&#x1F4F1;. They have a demo account, where we can learn binary options trading using demo money. I started trading. Since stock price is set by everyday people like me who are trading. They would be random, they have an equal probability of going up or down(50-50 probability).</p><p>I started trading. I just started with 10 demo dollars. To my surprise, I doubled my money within 24 trades. Just kidding&#x1F61C;. I lost all my demo money which was 10,000, after trading 10-15 times. . This sounds wrong. Maybe the app is biased and just try to scam money from people.</p><p>I realised this is not app&apos;s fault. It is my fault. I made an error in my calculations. I assumed that since the chance of something happening in succession is less, I have a good chance of winning. But when I do it over several times, the chance of me losing in succession (ex: getting tails in succession) at least once becomes larger. For example, the chance of getting two heads in succession in two throws is 1/4, but if I make four such throws, the chance of it happening at least one time is quite high. So, I would lose the second time, if I do that large number of times. Then you may say that just double the bet for the third time. If I lose again, then you would say, double the bet the fourth time.</p><p>But here is the problem. I assumed that there is no cap to the betting amount in reality, but I am wrong. Since I double or triple my bet amount every time I lose, the amount escalates quickly to a huge number. For example, if I started with 10 and tripled the bet amount every time. Then in the second bet, it would be 30, then 90,270,810, 2430, then 8290. If I lose that, I will lose all my money in my demo account. So, the max cap of money I have and the increasing probability when I do it many times say that I would lose all my money in the end. Luckily that was a demo account.</p><p>So, the takeaway for me is a small mistake in mathematics can cost you so much if you are not careful. I learned from my mistake. But I am going to apply t-statistic to the trend price of the stock in the summer.

<p>If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of &#x201C;a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other&#x2019;s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.&#x201D;</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I always been a no-sharer. From kindergarten to bachelor&apos;s degree. That&apos;s not because I m selfish. It was because, I never thought sharing our ideas will bring any fruitful result. I thought instead of sharing our ideas, explaining and convincing people. We can just work on our idea by ourselves and try to improve and implement it. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Share Your Work!&#x1F525;" loading="lazy" width="4827" height="3218" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sadswim?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">ian dooley</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>But I decided to give it a try. I created along with two of my friends a whatsapp group called <strong>study club</strong>, where we would share our ideas, and even our progress. This made me somewhat accountable to them. As time went on, I found that the club thrived (though sometimes we stopped it totally) in the long run. I also found that my relationship with them also improved and I started to learn from them more than what I was giving away. </p><p>Two days ago, <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/"><strong>Ali Abdaal </strong></a>(youtuber) tweeted asking for ideas for his next video on making a personal website. I shared my idea of hosting a ghost.org website with github pages. In this way, we don&apos;t need to pay any hosting cost and I suggested that it would be a boon for students who are starting it out. That comment got so much likes, and people commented asking for resources to do that. This made me realize, people really need &#xA0;this kind of stuff. Also, I realized &quot;something I thought to be simple &#x1F913;, may not be so simple to others, who are beginners&quot;. </p><p>Also, I found that sharing our work help us to get valuable feedback, which could totally change the work we are doing. No more days of spending days on a project, which is illogical but somehow our brain&#x1F9E0; couldn&apos;t catch that. </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
