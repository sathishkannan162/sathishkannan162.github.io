<p>If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of &#x201C;a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other&#x2019;s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.&#x201D;</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I always been a no-sharer. From kindergarten to bachelor&apos;s degree. That&apos;s not because I m selfish. It was because, I never thought sharing our ideas will bring any fruitful result. I thought instead of sharing our ideas, explaining and convincing people. We can just work on our idea by ourselves and try to improve and implement it. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Share Your Work!&#x1F525;" loading="lazy" width="4827" height="3218" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497032628192-86f99bcd76bc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE4MDE1NDg0&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sadswim?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">ian dooley</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>But I decided to give it a try. I created along with two of my friends a whatsapp group called <strong>study club</strong>, where we would share our ideas, and even our progress. This made me somewhat accountable to them. As time went on, I found that the club thrived (though sometimes we stopped it totally) in the long run. I also found that my relationship with them also improved and I started to learn from them more than what I was giving away. </p><p>Two days ago, <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/"><strong>Ali Abdaal </strong></a>(youtuber) tweeted asking for ideas for his next video on making a personal website. I shared my idea of hosting a ghost.org website with github pages. In this way, we don&apos;t need to pay any hosting cost and I suggested that it would be a boon for students who are starting it out. That comment got so much likes, and people commented asking for resources to do that. This made me realize, people really need &#xA0;this kind of stuff. Also, I realized &quot;something I thought to be simple &#x1F913;, may not be so simple to others, who are beginners&quot;. </p><p>Also, I found that sharing our work help us to get valuable feedback, which could totally change the work we are doing. No more days of spending days on a project, which is illogical but somehow our brain&#x1F9E0; couldn&apos;t catch that. </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
