It was about t-statistics &#x1F913;. &#xA0;A thought came to my mind about applying t-statistics to trend price of a stock and, in turn, make some sweet money&#x1F911;. Since I am going to have end semester exams soon in 2-3 days. It is on my bucket list for this summer.</p><p>Then this crazy idea hit me. Let&apos;s assume there is a gambling&#x1F3B2; game. The rules of the game are I can choose head or tail. More clearly, I can bet my money&#x1F4B2; on head or tail. Then a coin is tossed. If I get it right, then my money would double. If I lose, then my money would be gone.</p><p>This is my idea. I would bet, say, 100 in the head. If I win, I will take the 200, then I will bet 100 in head or tail according to my wish. Here is where things get a little interesting. If I lose, then I would bet 200 on the head again. Because the probability that I am going to get tail twice in succession is 1/4. Hence the probability of me winning is 3/4. Most probably, I will win now and go out with 400, that is 100 in profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="5616" height="3744" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526304640581-d334cdbbf45e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fG1vbmV5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTA2MA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sharonmccutcheon?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Sharon McCutcheon</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even if I lose the 2nd time. I would bet 800 on the head again. The probability of winning is 7/8 now. If I win now, I will walk away with 100 in profit in total. Even if I lose the 3rd time, I will double my bet as long as I want. In the end, I would always end up with 100 in profit. Cool!&#x1F60E; Right? I found the infinite money glitch&#x1F4B8;&#x2014;no more worries for the rest of my life.</p><p>Now, I decided to test my theory, but I didn&apos;t want to risk real money. I knew about the binary options in the Olymp trade&#x1F4C8;. In which, you have to predict whether the price of a specific stock will be greaterup or less than the current price after a specific amount of time. If I win, I will get up to 82% to 10% of the money I have placed. To increase my chance of making a profit, since I wouldn&apos;t get 100% of the money I placed. I decided to triple the betting amount If I lose. This would significantly increase my profit.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How I almost lost my money| Infinite money glitch." loading="lazy" width="3999" height="2666" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591696205602-2f950c417cb9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fHRyYWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYxOTAzMTQxMg&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Markus Winkler</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I downloaded the app&#x1F4F1;. They have a demo account, where we can learn binary options trading using demo money. I started trading. Since stock price is set by everyday people like me who are trading. They would be random, they have an equal probability of going up or down(50-50 probability).</p><p>I started trading. I just started with 10 demo dollars. To my surprise, I doubled my money within 24 trades. Just kidding&#x1F61C;. I lost all my demo money which was 10,000, after trading 10-15 times. . This sounds wrong. Maybe the app is biased and just try to scam money from people.</p><p>I realised this is not app&apos;s fault. It is my fault. I made an error in my calculations. I assumed that since the chance of something happening in succession is less, I have a good chance of winning. But when I do it over several times, the chance of me losing in succession (ex: getting tails in succession) at least once becomes larger. For example, the chance of getting two heads in succession in two throws is 1/4, but if I make four such throws, the chance of it happening at least one time is quite high. So, I would lose the second time, if I do that large number of times. Then you may say that just double the bet for the third time. If I lose again, then you would say, double the bet the fourth time.</p><p>But here is the problem. I assumed that there is no cap to the betting amount in reality, but I am wrong. Since I double or triple my bet amount every time I lose, the amount escalates quickly to a huge number. For example, if I started with 10 and tripled the bet amount every time. Then in the second bet, it would be 30, then 90,270,810, 2430, then 8290. If I lose that, I will lose all my money in my demo account. So, the max cap of money I have and the increasing probability when I do it many times say that I would lose all my money in the end. Luckily that was a demo account.</p><p>So, the takeaway for me is a small mistake in mathematics can cost you so much if you are not careful. I learned from my mistake. But I am going to apply t-statistic to the trend price of the stock in the summer.

<p>If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of &#x201C;a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other&#x2019;s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.&#x201D;</p>

I created along with two of my friends a whatsapp group called <strong>study club</strong>, where we would share our ideas, and even our progress. This made me somewhat accountable to them. As time went on, I found that the club thrived (though sometimes we stopped it totally) in the long run. I also found that my relationship with them also improved and I started to learn from them more than what I was giving away. </p><p>Two days ago, <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/"><strong>Ali Abdaal </strong></a>(youtuber) tweeted asking for ideas for his next video on making a personal website. I shared my idea of hosting a ghost.org website with github pages. In this way, we don&apos;t need to pay any hosting cost and I suggested that it would be a boon for students who are starting it out. That comment got so much likes, and people commented asking for resources to do that. This made me realize, people really need &#xA0;this kind of stuff. Also, I realized &quot;something I thought to be simple &#x1F913;, may not be so simple to others, who are beginners&quot;. </p><p>Also, I found that sharing our work help us to get valuable feedback, which could totally change the work we are doing. No more days of spending days on a project, which is illogical but somehow our brain&#x1F9E0; couldn&apos;t catch that. </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
